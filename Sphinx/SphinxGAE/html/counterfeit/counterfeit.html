<p>Counterfeit product substitution is estimated to cost the global economy $1.7 trillion in 2015.
Almost every category of manufactured product has been, and is being, counterfeited.</p>
<p>Digital movie piracy, fake watches in flea markets and counterfeit high fashion goods sold in the boutiques of Paris and Shanghai
are examples of economically costly counterfeit product substitution.</p>
<p>More serious are counterfeit products that are unsafe. Car seat belt buckles made of inferior metal and
used aircraft parts that have been substituted for new parts.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most pernicious and persistent problem is counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
Counterfeit pharmaceuticals in Least Developed Countries (LDC) are a particularly serious problem, with studies showing
counterfeit rates of some anti-malarial drugs (Artemisinin) as high as 30% in Asia <a class="reference internal" href="#cf2012" id="id1">[CF2012]</a> and 50%
in Africa <a class="reference internal" href="#cf2013" id="id2">[CF2013]</a>.</p>
<p>The conventional technique to combat pharmaceutical counterfeiting is Ramen Spectroscopy which analyses the ingredients of
suspect pharmaceuticals. This is a powerful and effective technique but it requires expensive equipment, trained staff and
can only analyse a small proportion of the suspect pharmaceuticals sold.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing a powerful weapon in the fight against counterfeiting - the smart phone.</strong></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Smart phones are now cheap. Spurred on by vast markets in less developed countries, phone manufacturers
have aggressively cut prices. In July 2014 a smart-phone with a 1.2 Ghz dual

</ul>
<p>To do this, the techniques of <em>Serialization</em>, <em>Location</em> and <em>Trust Hierarchies</em> can be applied. These are explained below.</p>

<p>Serialization is a simple and powerful tool against counterfeiting.
A guaranteed unique serial code, a number or text sequence, is attached to the product or
aggregate packaging (carton, pallet or container).</p>
<p>The serial codes can be used to <em>authenticate</em> a genuine product.</p>
<p>Serial codes can also be used to track products from manufacture, through the distribution channel, to final purchase.
This can be used to implement the usual tasks of distribution and inventory.
Also, importantly, <em>Track and Trace</em> can also be used to detect where, who and when unauthorised diversion of products
occurred, theft or compromise of the distribution channel through the introduction of counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>The image on the above left shows the format of serial coding (&#8220;SN&#8221;) of pharmaceutical retail packaging that will be introduced
into the United States by 2018. The 2D Barcode carrier is a GS1 standard (ECC200) DataMatrix.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">As a demonstration of how serialization works, you can scan the Barcode with a freeware smart-phone barcode

<h3>Track and Trace, Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#track-and-trace-authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><em>Track and Trace</em>, as the name suggests, uses the product serial code to produce an audit log of all movements
of a product in the distribution channel from manufacturer to consumer. This audit log is called the ePedigree of
the product and confirms the integrity of the distribution channel of the product.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last"><em>Authentication</em> systems use a guaranteed <em>unique</em> serial code to authenticate a product.
Without special packaging (see Ghana, <em>mPedigree</em> below), serial codes printed as Text or Barcodes are <strong>not</strong> guaranteed to be
<em>unique</em> until they can be checked against a database.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical-implementation-of-serialization">
<h3>Physical Implementation of Serialization<a class="headerlink" href="#physical-implementation-of-serialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Text and Barcodes</strong></p>
<p>Serial codes can be implemented physically as Text or a Barcode and, most often, both.
The 2D DataMatrix Barcode shown above is a GS1 standard (ECC200) Barcode and the information contained within
the Barcode also follows GS1 formatting standards. This standard will be adopted in the United States and probably by Europe (EU)
for serial coding pharmaceutical unit (retail) packaging by 2018.</p>
<p>Text and Barcodes can be printed using suitable high speed printers on existing production lines. Setup costs
for manufacturers implementing serial codes are relatively cheap and ongoing production costs to print serial codes are also low.
Therefore, this technology is attractive to manufacturers who need to implement serial coding on existing packaging lines.
Another advantage of printed barcodes is that they are can be read
and processed using freeware software on relatively low-end smart phones.</p>
<p>An obvious attack on printed serial codes by a counterfeiter is to duplicate a valid code on the counterfeit packaging.
Therefore, if the serial code is implemented as Text or a Barcode on the unit packaging then the serial code
must be confirmed as unique. This is done by marking the code off on a database when it is purchased or used.
If a serial code previously recorded as purchased or used
is again presented on a package for purchase or use, then counterfeiting is immediately detected.</p>
<p><strong>RFID Chips</strong></p>
<p>Serial codes can be uniquely encrypted into RFID chips. Every RFID Chip carries a permanent unique ID code and cannot be copied.
RFID chips also have a significantly larger data payload than Barcodes. RFID chips have unbreakable on-chip encryption engines
implemented in hardware (3DES). RFID chips are reliably scanned in a production line environment (and at relatively longer distances).</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Serial codes encrypted onto RFID chips can be easily authenticated and verified as unique <em>without</em> reference
to an external database (they can be authenticated off-line). RFID chips are the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; for serial code authentication.</p>
</div>
<p>RFID chips are considered expensive at a cost of around USD$0.10 per RFID label in volume (from $0.01 to $1.00 depending
on volume, type and packaging, source: Alibaba.com, July 2014).
However, they are cheap enough to be widely used in disposable tickets in urban transport systems. RFID chips can be read/written
by most high-end Android phones - termed Near Field Communication (NFC). Low and mid-level phones currently do not support
NFC in hardware. This is the disadvantage of RFID chips, they cannot be accessed using universally available
hardware (a cheap smart phone). This would be an issue for universal (purchaser/user) product authentication. But would not be
an issue in a secure <em>Track and Trace</em> system.</p>

<div class="section" id="sequences-of-serial-codes">
<h3>Sequences of Serial Codes.<a class="headerlink" href="#sequences-of-serial-codes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order for serial codes to be secure:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A counterfeiter must not be able anticipate or reproduce the sequence of serial codes.</li>
<li>For a serial code to authenticate a product the verifier (purchaser/user/distributor) needs to be able to confirm
that only the Manufacturer, Government or NGO (the <em>Trusted Entity</em>) could have generated the serial code.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Anecdotally, some US pharmaceutical manufacturers are planning to produce sequential serial codes when implementing the
requirements of the DQSA Act (see below). This is egregiously careless; sequential
codes are trivially easy to counterfeit and cannot be authenticated.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Random Sequences</strong></p>
<p>European and most United States manufacturers have responded to this requirement by producing serial codes that
are random sequences (requirement 1). Authenticating the serial code and thus the product is done by referring back to a
database with a list of generated serial codes.</p>
<p>Although this achieves both requirements, it requires secure access to the serial code database.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge (NIZK) Encryption</strong></p>
<p>A better serial coding solution is to use is a &#8216;Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proof&#8217; (NIZK) verification algorithm that does not need a database
link.  Using this technique, the NIZK algorithm verifies that the serial code was generated by an
authorised <em>Manufactuer, Government or NGO</em> without the need to communicate and without knowing how the serial code was
generated. Although this is somewhat more complex, well proven cryptographic software libraries are readily available
(never attempt to write cryptographic software in-house).  The advantage is that the verification process is greatly simplified
and more secure.</p>
<p>NIZK serial codes only provide proof of uniqueness if implemented on an RFID chip. Text and Barcodes
can always be copied and these must be checked against a database to establish uniqueness. However, the counterfeiter does
not know the code sequence, so it is likely they will only copy one or a few codes. So Text and Barcodes with an NIZK
serial code can provide a partial authentication with a reasonable level of confidence. The partial
authentication scans can then be queued and checked against a database for uniqueness when the phone (or scanning device)
is on-line.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="potential-problems-with-serial-coding">
<h3>Potential Problems with Serial Coding<a class="headerlink" href="#potential-problems-with-serial-coding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For serial codes to work, a serial code must be on the final use packaging. This may seem obvious but serial codes
have not yet been mandated in the Least Developed Countries where the problem of counterfeiting is most severe.
In addition, countries where most counterfeit pharmaceuticals are sourced; Nigeria, Pakistan, China and India have not
mandated the introduction of serial coding. This could be overcome by Governments or NGOs requiring all packaging
to be serial coded, or alternately, that serial codes be manually affixed to packaging.</p>
<p>The problem with the authentication step is again obvious. Unless counterfeit packaging is checked when purchased or used,
then serial coding cannot be authenticated (See Turkey below). The US and EU will address this problem by requiring pharmacists and healthcare
professionals to scan serial codes at point of purchase or use. However, if serial code authentication is performed
sparsely and haphazardly then counterfeits may not be identified or may only be identified after many counterfeit units
have been sold.</p>

<p><strong>Simple and Effective Authentication</strong></p>
<p>The <em>mPegigree</em> system was the first use of a serialization to authenticate pharmaceuticals.
It was launched in 2007 in Ghana by Ghanaian entrepreneur Bright Simons. It is brilliantly simple and cost effective.
A text serial code is placed under a tamper proof scratch off covering. The pharmaceutical purchaser scratches off the covering
to reveal the serial code. They then enter the code as an SMS text message which is sent to a toll free number.
A return SMS message authenticates the purchase.</p>
<p>The <em>mPedigree</em> system was introduced into Nigeria in 2010 and India in 2011.
Kenya is currently (July 2014) introducing the system
and there are advanced plans to introduce <em>mPedigree</em> into Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
<p>By its design, the serial code is only revealed by the purchaser and the mPedigree system cannot be used to
implement a <em>Track and Trace</em> system.</p>

<div class="section" id="turkey">
<h3>Turkey<a class="headerlink" href="#turkey" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p><strong>Track and Trace but no Authentication, a Cautionary Tale</strong></p>
<p>The pioneering use of serial codes to implement a pharmaceutical <em>Track and Trace</em> system was with the Turkish Ministry of Health
who developed the ITS system (also called the Medical Tracking System in English). The primary objective of the system
was to reduce insurance fraud by pharmacists reporting inflated sales.  It is not currently compulsory for pharmacists
to authenticate medicines in the ITS system.</p>
<p>There are claims that the system has assisted police apprehend counterfeiters: <em>&#8216;Over the last two years, police have seized
approximately 2 million packages of counterfeit medications, worth 6 million Turkish Lira, which were sold either on the internet,
by patients&#8217; relatives and even in some pharmacies, which acted as intermediaries for counterfeiters.&#8217; (Turkish SEtimes)</em>.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that apparently the counterfeit pharmaceuticals were not introduced into the supply chain by
manufacturers or distributors, but by vendors - retail pharmacists. We will see this theme again when the supply
of counterfeit pharmaceuticals in regional Uganda is examined.</p>
<p>In December 2013 counterfeit cancer drugs were found to have been sold to cancer patients. Some of the
counterfeit cancer drugs reached the United States via a circuitous route and American citizens were implicated
in the scam.</p>
<p>It is worth quoting the response of Turkish drug manufacturers at length:</p>
<p><em>&#8216;Turkey&#8217;s Association of Research-Based Pharmaceutical Companies (AIFD) issued a statement in the wake of the operation
noting that the counterfeiting operation is &#8220;alarming&#8221;, particularly as the country has implemented a national programme
of medicine serialisation via 2D barcodes - the drug tracking system (ITS) - which should make it hard to carry out this
sort of illegal activity.</em></p>
<p><em>&#8216;The AIFD points to a potential weakness in the system in its statement, noting: &#8220;to ensure impeccable functionality of
those safeguards, the 2D barcode on a product purchased must be scanned and checked on the system at the pharmacy to verify
its authenticity, since having a 2D barcode alone may not necessarily attest to the authenticity of the product; the 2D barcode
must be verified on the system.&#8217;</em></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;It recommends that all 2D barcodes on medicine packs are scanned and verified in pharmacies, and the product checked to make
sure it has not been re-packaged or removed from the original packaging.&#8217;</strong> [my emphasis]</p>
<p>There are related two points to be made from the Turkish experience.  Firstly, that a voluntary system will be ignored or
misused by compromised vendors (pharmacists). Secondly, once again the problem appears at the vendor level and does not appear to
involve higher levels of the distribution channel.</p>

<p><strong>A Standards Swamp</strong></p>
<p>The United States and Europe (EU) have both mandated the serialization of pharmaceuticals by 2018.</p>
<p><strong>The United States</strong></p>
<p>President Barack Obama signed H.R. 3204, the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA),
into law in November 2013. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must have serial codes on unit packaging by November 2017.</p>
<p>The relevant parts of the legislation concerning serialization are reproduced below.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;SEC. 581. DEFINITIONS&#8217;: &#8216;(14) PRODUCT IDENTIFIER .... means a standardized graphic that includes,
in both human-readable form and on a machine-readable data carrier ....the standardized numerical identifier,
lot number, and expiration date of the product.&#8217; and &#8216;(20) STANDARDIZED NUMERICAL IDENTIFIER .... means a set of numbers or
characters used to uniquely identify each package or homogeneous case that is composed of the National Drug Code .... combined
with a unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>In other words the specification is consistent with a GS1 formatted DataMatrix, although machine readable could also apply to
a RFID chip. Importantly - there is no specification on how the <em>&#8216;STANDARDIZED NUMERICAL IDENTIFIER&#8217;</em> is to be generated.
Simply that it is a <em>&#8216;unique alphanumeric serial number of up to 20 characters.&#8217;</em>. This could apply to a sequential sequence.</p>
<p>The relevant parts of the legislation concerning authentication using serialization are reproduced below.</p>
<p><em>&#8216;SEC. 582. REQUIREMENTS&#8217; ,(b)(4)(C): .... upon receiving a request for verification from an authorized repackager,
wholesale distributor, or dispenser that is in possession or control of a product ...., a manufacturer shall....notify
the person making the request whether the product identifier, including the standardized numerical identifier, that is the
subject of the request corresponds to the product identifier affixed or imprinted by the manufacturer.&#8217;</em></p>
<p>In other words the manufacturer only needs to respond to <em>&#8216;receiving a request for verification from an authorized&#8217;</em>
[entity]. Authentication will <strong>not</strong> be available to purchasers or end-users.</p>
<p><strong>Europe</strong></p>
<p>Directive 2001/83/EC and Directive 2011/62/EU of the European Parliament has mandated the introduction of pharmaceutical
anti-counterfeit technology (serialization). Under the European federal system
these directives must then be passed into legislation by each of the member countries and it is expected that this will be
completed by 2017.</p>
<p>An alliance of European pharmaceutical organisations (EAEPC-EFPIA-GIRP-PGEU)
has responded with a proposal for the technical specifications of serialization.</p>
<p>The data carrier will be a GS1 (ECC200 or ISO/IEC 16022) 2D DataMatrix (no provision for RFID). Serial codes will be randomly
generated (good). Where the European proposal differs from the Americans is the product identifier. The US has a National Drug
Code (NDC) which is easily extended to a GS1 Global Trade Identification Number (GTIN). However, the Europeans have
a variety of legacy national drug codes that cannot be converted to a GTIN.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The frequency of counterfeit products is highly dependent on location and specific vendor.
For example, in Mbarara district, Uganda, the probability of buying counterfeit antimalarials doubles if purchased from
a vendor who has previously sold counterfeit antimalarials.</p>
</div>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/UgandaCounterfeit.png"><img alt="../_images/UgandaCounterfeit.png" class="align-center" src="../_images/UgandaCounterfeit.png" style="width: 650px; height: 700px;" /></a>
<p>The table above shows the frequency of antimalarial drugs (Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy - ACT) in 4 districts
in Uganda. The frequency of counterfeit drugs varies considerably with district (All Shops column). Researchers <a class="reference internal" href="#cf2013" id="id3">[CF2013]</a>
in Uganda also find that purchasers overestimate the quality of antimalarials purchased. In addition, there is only a weak
or non-existent relationship between pharmaceutical quality and price <a class="reference internal" href="#cf2011" id="id4">[CF2011]</a>. Presumably this is to prevent the purchaser
receiving adverse signals about the quality of the pharmaceuticals from price.</p>
<p>The most interesting
finding of <a class="reference internal" href="#cf2013" id="id5">[CF2013]</a> is that the probability of of purchasing counterfeit antimalarials doubles if the vendor has previously
sold counterfeit antimalarials (Conditional column).</p>
<p>The immediate implication is that some vendors are not just passive conduits of counterfeits sourced further up the
distribution channel, but are actively <em>facilitating</em> the sale of
counterfeit antimalarials. A major objective of any <em>Track and Trace</em> system should be to modify vendor behaviour.</p>
<p>An open user-based <em>review</em> system such as Google maps or the travel site <em>Trip Advisor</em> cannot be
used to assess the quality of vendors.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Purchasers (in general) lack the technical capability (Ramen Spectroscopy or similar) to properly analyse
and review pharmaceuticals.</li>
<li>Non-compliant vendors will simply arrange for false reviews to be posted.</li>
</ol>
<p>This can only be done with a formal
compliance and audit system where purchased pharmaceuticals are periodically analysed for quality.  Vendors who are
compliant with quality standards are granted &#8216;authorised dealer&#8217; status, see <em>Trust Hierarchy</em> below.</p>
<p>Vendors should be highly motivated to gain &#8216;authorized dealer&#8217; status because the <em>Track and Trace</em> application will show a
higher probability of purchasing genuine pharmaceuticals from &#8216;authorized dealers&#8217;.</p>
<p>There are 14 pharmacies in Mbarara township, from the table above,
half of them sell genuine pharmaceuticals. These vendors should be rewarded with &#8216;authorized dealer&#8217; status.</p>

<p>Trust Hierarchies work like an authorized car dealership.  Dealers comply with car manufacturer
quality standards and in return are granted the privilege of &#8216;authorized dealer&#8217;.
This is economically beneficial to the dealer; customers preferentially purchase from &#8216;authorized dealers&#8217; because
they know the dealer meets manufacturer quality standards.</p>
<p>The Trust Hierarchy formalizes this relationship using cryptographic certificates that can be conveniently

<p class="last">Certificates are implemented as X509 certificates. These are used in your web browser for secure
communication using https. You can view X509 certificates by connecting to a website using https and clicking on
the padlock symbol.</p>
</div>
<p>There are three types of authorisation certificates in the trusted hierarchy.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>Trusted Entity</em> Certificates [X.509 terminology - a Certificate Authority]</li>
</ol>
<p>This certificate is at the apex of the trust hierarchy.
It has the ability to cryptographically verify subordinate certificates and can issue and sign new
subordinate certificates.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Distributor Certificates [X.509 terminology - Intermediate Certificate]</li>
</ol>
<p>In a global distribution network it is unrealistic for the <em>Trusted Entity</em> to verify and
issue certificates to all (particularly the lower) levels of the distribution channel. Therefore trusted authorised
distributors are empowered to issue certificates further down the distribution channel. These lower level certificates
are signed by the trusted distributor issuing the certificate and, importantly, cannot be repudiated by the issuer.
It is implicit that the trusted distributor is responsible for the behaviour of
subordinate distributors and vendors holding certificates they have issued.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Subordinate (Vendor) Certificates [X.509 terminology - User Certificate]</li>
</ol>
<p>This certificate cannot issue subordinate certificates.
Typically these certificates are issued to low-level distributors and vendors.</p>
<p>Products moving through the distribution channel are scanned using trust certificates and this creates a log of product
movement through the distribution channel. This can be used to identify where counterfeit products have entered the
distribution channel or where products have been diverted or stolen.
The <em>Trusted Entity</em> can then take corrective action by revoking or restricting the authorization certificates of
distributors or vendors in the compromised section of the distribution channel.</p>

<li><em>(Optional) The product cryptographic serial code is scanned by a phone, tablet or barcode reader.</em></li>
<li><em>(Optional) The vendor/distributor authorization certificate is verified.</em></li>

<p>The software components are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A thin client app that captures the serial code as a Barcode, RFID chip or Text input, depending on device capability.
It then transmits this and other data (time, location, device and trust certificate) to the GAE back-end.</li>
<li>Back-end software hosted on GAE then stores all entered serial codes
and implements verification/credibility logic.</li>
</ol>
<div class="admonition note">
